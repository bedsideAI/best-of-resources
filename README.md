### [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and (dataframe) manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.
- [Pandas 1.x Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/product/pandas-1-x-cookbook-second-edition/9781839213106) - ($) Excellent resource for folks who use pandas everyday.

### [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
Simple and efficient tools for predictive analysis. Industry favourite (easy to understand and well designed API). 
- [Hands on Machine Learning (HOML) with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow 2nd Ed](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) - ($) Worth every penny!
- [scikit-learn Tutorial](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html) - Great overview of ML (even if you don't want to use sklearn)

### [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications. I think it's generally agreed that this is the most popular deep learning platform for industry. Newcomers can get started with TensorFlow quickly using the high-level API called **Keras**
- [Deep Learning with Python 1st Ed](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python) - ($) Great intoduction to ML and Deep Learning written by Keras creator Francois Chollet
- [Deep Learning with Python 2nd Ed](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition) - ($) 2nd edition in Manning early access preview (Jan 2021)
- [Hands on Machine Learning (HOML) with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow 2nd Ed](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/) - ($) Perhaps the most complete coverage of TF 2.0 for beginners (2021).

### [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)
An open source machine learning framework that accelerates the path from research prototyping to production deployment. Often described as the most "pythonic" of the deep learning libraries. **Extremely popular in the research community** due to high extensibility and eager execution by default (straightforward debugging).
